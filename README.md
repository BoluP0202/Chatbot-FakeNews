IDK what I'm doing man...
 working rule based Chat bot committed as of 9 pm Thursday

Okay so a proper read me.
This repository includes several modules
1. <span style = "color:green">News categoriser.ipynb</span> - The Model Training Document
2. <span style = "color:red">Chattler.py</span> - The python file that uses the model's data to determine truth
3. <span style = "color:blue">Chattles.py</span> - The python file that contains the Rule based chatbot
There is also an experimental function utilising spacy for NER
this function is contained in <span style = "color:yellow">NER.py</span> and is called in <span style = "color:red">Chattles.py</span>

To run it you need just <span style = "color:red">Chattler</span>, <span style = "color:blue">Chattles</span> and <span style = "color:yellow">NER</span>, not even <span style = "color:yellow">NER</span> really. and You run Chattles. in an ideal world Chattles would be called elsewherenbut life is a journey

Work might continue soon but times are hard
also the regex might be bad (i forgot to test it)
